# Sniffer-and-network-protocols

The project was carried out as part of a cyber risk assessment course in order to deeply understand communication protocols and protection levels against a sniffer.
The project contains two main tasks:
1. Creating a new communication protocol and validating a sniffer.
2. Adding protections to the protocol against the attacker.

Requirements:
python==3.8.10
scapy==2.4.5
** To run the adversary scripts in task 3, you must use the terminal as ROOT. (e.g. sudo python3 adversary3.py)
